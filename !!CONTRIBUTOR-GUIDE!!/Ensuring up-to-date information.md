For creating a credible public health course, especially about sleep, you should rely on authoritative academic and scientific sources rather than podcasters. Here's how to effectively gather and present research:

## Primary Research Sources

**Academic Databases**
- PubMed for biomedical literature and research papers[1]
- Scopus for interdisciplinary scientific research[1]
- Google Scholar for linking to academic articles[1]

**Authoritative Organizations**
- National Institutes of Health (NIH)[2]
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)[2]
- World Health Organization (WHO)[6]

## Evaluation Criteria

**Source Credibility**
- Look for peer-reviewed academic journals[8]
- Check author credentials and expertise[2]
- Verify publication dates for current information[2]

**Content Quality**
- Ensure research is evidence-based and methodologically sound[8]
- Look for objective presentation of findings[8]
- Verify if the work has been reviewed by health care professionals[2]

## Best Practices

**Research Organization**
- Use consistent citation styles (APA or AMA format)[8]
- Maintain an organized portfolio of sources[8]
- Cross-reference findings across multiple credible sources[2]

**Content Development**
- Start with foundational research from established medical institutions
- Build upon peer-reviewed studies rather than individual interpretations
- Focus on evidence-based protocols and interventions
- Update content regularly with new research findings

This approach ensures your course material is based on rigorous scientific evidence rather than individual interpretations or potentially biased sources.
